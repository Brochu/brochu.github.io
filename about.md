Hi, my name is Alexandre Brochu and I am a computer programmer that has been interested in computer science for a long time. I was also interested in the game programming domain for 8 years. I started studying computer programming from high school through to University. In high school and cegep, I practiced writing code and learnt about good conding standards. When I studied in university at the Sherbrooke University, there was a bigger emphasis on more abstract ideas about computer science and different algorithms to solve problems encountered in multiple domains of computer programming.

### First Contact

My first contact with computer programming happened early in my life. When I was studying basic maths operations in grade school, my father wrote a simple program to validate my answers automatically. I found this interested but I was too young to really get into it then.

After this, when I was about 10 years old, I asked my father to teach me some simple languages so I could write programs myself. When I used those tools to create some programs, I began being more and more interested at the way languages worked behind the scenes. This desire to understand pushed me to find out about a school that had a special computer program.

With my introduction to computer programming done, I went on to cegep to learn more and practice writing code in multiple situiations with good coding standards. There I learnt a lot about databases, connecting a program to a database and web applications. At that point I knew I want  to work in computer programming but I had yet to find the domain I was the most interested in.

### Gaming and University

Then I realised that one of my favorite hobby involved an important computer science and computer programming: video games. I started playing video games early and when I realised a lot of programming efforts went in the production of this media I wanted to know more about this creation process. After I learnt more about game creation, I knew this domain of computer programming was the one that interested me the most. From that point on, I worked on simple games to learn the specific ways of game programming.

While I was studying in university, I chose to pick the most courses that could relate in a way to game programming. Since there was a program that specialised in 3D rendering, I did a lot of courses about different ways to approch computer rendering and animation.

After finishing my studies at Sherbrooke University, I worked on some of my personal projects while searching for a job in the game development domain.

### Game Development Career

Not too long after looking for a job in game development, I got the opportunity to start working for a game company located in Ottawa, Ontario. The company was called Fuel Industries and I was hired as a gameplay programmer to start working on mobile projects.

I was able to start working on a project in the beginning stages and I stayed in the team until first release. I got to work very closely with the 3D artists and animators since these were involved in the main gameplay aspects of the game. I was working for them for 1 year and then I started to look for some other challenges.

I succeeded to have a chance at working in the Montréal scene when I was hired at Behaviour Interactive. It started in a very similar way with some mobile projects moslty. After some work and with new experience gained, I moved onto some different style of projects (Steam, PC, Stadia platforms). I got to work a lot with tools like Unity3D at first and then I moved onto working mostly with Unreal Engine 4. I also got the chance to work with some in-house made engines from clients.

### New Interests

These days, I am still working in game development and I enjoy it every day still. I have my own personal projects going on in parallel with the ones I work with on my day job. Some of these are described in more details on the main page of this portfolio.

Lately, I did notice that I development some interest in a new aspect of programming. I started looking into graphics programming and learned how to use some of the popular graphics API like DirectX 11 and Vulkan. I really enjoy working on some programming projects where I know I will have some visual feedback for the work I put in. I also like working on some code that should run in real-time which makes graphics programming perfect for my taste.

Some of my graphics oriented projects can also be found on my portfolio. I know that I am starting out in this domain but I will keep working on it and get better to slowly move onto working on more complicated ideas.
