Hi, my name is Alexandre Brochu and I am a computer programmer that has been interested in computer science for a long time. I was also interested in the game programming domain for 8 years. I started studying computer programming from high school through to University. In high school and cegep, I practiced writing code and learnt about good conding standards. When I studied in university at the Sherbrooke University, there was a bigger emphasis on more abstract ideas about computer science and different algorithms to solve problems encountered in multiple domains of computer programming.

### First contact

My first contact with computer programming happened early in my life. When I was studying basic maths operations in grade school, my father wrote a simple program to validate my answers automatically. I found this interested but I was too young to really get into it then.

After this, when I was about 10 years old, I asked my father to teach me some simple languages so I could write programs myself. When I used those tools to create some programs, I began being more and more interested at the way languages worked behind the scenes. This desire to understand pushed me to find out about a school that had a special computer program.

With my introduction to computer programming done, I went on to cegep to learn more and practice writing code in multiple situiations with good coding standards. There I learnt a lot about databases, connecting a program to a database and web applications. At that point I knew I want  to work in computer programming but I had yet to find the domain I was the most interested in.

### Next step

Then I realised that one of my favorite hobby involved an important computer science and computer programming: video games. I started playing video games early and when I realised a lot of programming efforts went in the production of this media I wanted to know more about this creation process. After I learnt more about game creation, I knew this domain of computer programming was the one that interested me the most. From that point on, I worked on simple games to learn the specific ways of game programming.

While I was studying in university, I chose to pick the most courses that could relate in a way to game programming. Since there was a program that specialised in 3D rendering, I did a lot of courses about different ways to approch computer rendering and animation.

Since I finished my studies at Sherbrooke University, I work on some of my personal projects while seeking for a job in the game development domain.
