description: An algorithm that would move 2D shapes based on the idea of 3D models skinning.
---

This project came to me after studying the abstract concepts behind the skinning algorithms used in the game programming and animated movies industries. I learnt that the concept would also be applicable in an environment in 2D. I am interested in creating a simple program with Javascript to show how it applies to 2D. At the same time, I would like to make that program interactive so people can see what effects the different properties have on the visual result.

I am also still interested in working with the canvas object of HTML5. I want to use this media to output the visual result to the screen. One big positive point about canvas is that I can put up this demo online.

I know Ubisoft already created some games with an engine that used some ideas behind the skinning algorithms for a 2d game. It is possible that I will try to see what I can learn from this before going in and completing this project.

However, this project is still only an idea. I will put up a link to try the program online on this website as soon as it is done.
