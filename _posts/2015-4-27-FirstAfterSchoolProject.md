description: In-Browser simple pool game w/ Canvas element.
---

I chose to do this project to practice the use of the new HTML5 element 'canvas'. This object is usually placed in a web page and the rendering as well as the interactions are done with Javascript linked to the page. This game is a simple billiards game. This idea came to me when I remembered playing a game called 'Lunar Pool' on the Nintendo Entertainment System when I was younger. For more info on 'Lunar Pool', here is a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Pool) you can visit.

Since this game was made from scratch, I try to keep the graphics simple and done directly with the functions provided by the canvas element. One thing I found while working with those functions is that they approximately work the same as opengl functions. Since I already worked with opengl functions, I was happy to learn that this knowledge was transferable.

Since this project is still in development, I cannot provide a link to try out the full game. However, I will provide a link to test the game when it will be a little more polished.
