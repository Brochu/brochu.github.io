This project was to explore the signal processing domain of computer science. The idea was to take some musical instrument sound as input and process it so the program would output a human readable file like guitar tablatures for example.

Since this project was done in a university course, I had to present the results and development process to some other people. The external link will point to the presentation used in class.
