This idea came from a game I played when I was younger on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The original game I played is called Lunar Pool ([More info here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Pool)). The idea was to try out using the canvas object of HTML5 with javascript to create a simple pool game. I never used this technology before so it was a kind of test to see the limits of javascript in game programming.
