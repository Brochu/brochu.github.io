I chose to do this project to practice the use of the new HTML5 element 'canvas'. This object is usually placed in a web page and the rendering as well as the interactions are done with javascript linked to the page. This game is a simple billiards game. This idea came to me when I remembered playing a game called 'Lunar Pool' on the Nintendo Entertainment System when I was younger. For more info on 'Lunar Pool', here is a [link](http://google.com) you can visit.
