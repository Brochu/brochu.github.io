    <p>Hi, my name is Alexandre Brochu. I have been studying computer programming / computer science since high school and have been interested in game development for some time now. I currently work on some game project on my own while seeking for a job in the domain. Here's a small website for me to put up information about those projects so people can have an idea of what I am working on. Demos, screenshots and download links should be available for you to see or try the different games.</p>

    <p>For more info about me, please visite the <a href="/about">about page</a></p>

    <p>Here is a list of what I am working on lately : </p>
